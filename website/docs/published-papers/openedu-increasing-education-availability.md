## Abstract

The education world has moved from analogue mediums to digital.
This offers teachers the opportunity to take advantage of tools and features that can decrease the load.
By using new technologies, we increase the availability of educational content by hosting it online, and we can increase its quality by allowing outside contributions to the content.
Teachers can use their time more efficiently by handling menial tasks like spell checking through automated scripts which enables them to scale up the number of tasks they can handle in parallel.
This paper proposes the Open Education Hub framework, which introduces automation that makes eases the task of creating materials, deploys materials through public platforms, to allow more access to the resources, and automatically checks student assignment work.

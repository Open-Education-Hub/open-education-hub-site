Hello!
I'm Liza, I am a contributor to the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016).
I operate beyond the scenes with ideas to the methodology of the project and I take care of the project overall presentation.

I finished my Masters degree in Advanced Cybersecurity in 2019 at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania.
I am also a teaching assistant at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, being involved in Computer Programming, Operating Systems and Hardware-Software Interface classes.
I am interested in operating systems, security, low-level programming and a big fan of open source.
I love spending time with students, teaching and finding ways to improve the current education system.

I currently work at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/) as a software engineer, part of the [Connected Home Security](https://www.bitdefender.com/smart-home/) team.

Apart from computer science, I really enjoy skiing, dancing and cooking.

Hi!
I'm Răzvan, I am the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016) director.
I supervise project activities and I am engaged in content development for the [Operating Systems class](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/operating-systems-oer/) and the [Security Summer School](https://github.com/security-summer-school/).
I am in charge of engaging the teaching staff at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest and other universities and educational institutions in Romania.

I am an Associate Professor at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania, the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
I am primarily interested in operating systems and security, with a penchant for teaching and mentoring.
If a class uses "operating systems" as part of its name, it's likely I'm part of the team.
Research-wise I work on software security, particularly [Apple iOS security](https://github.com/malus-security/) and [the Unikraft unikernel](https://unikraft.org/) in recent years.
I am part of the open source and security community in the university and in Romania.

Hi!
I'm Hulda.
I have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Mathematical Education and a Masters degree in Upper Secondary Education of Mathematics.
My role in the OpenEdu project is to review the content of the Computing and Calculus for Applied Statistics (CCAS) course at the University of Iceland and adapt it to the new system developed by Open Education Hub.

I work full time as a math teacher at the Commercial College of Iceland and as a part time teacher at the University of Iceland.
I particularly enjoy teaching Calculus, Probability and Statistics, but I am also interested in the field of Combinatorics.

I spend most of my spare time taking care of my indoor jungle, doodling and weight lifting.

## Eggert Karl Hafsteinsson

Hi!
My name is Eggert Karl.
I'm a math educator.
I have a Masters degree in Mathematics (Multivariate Complex Analysis), Bachelors degrees in Applied Mathematics as well as Computer Science and have an additional diploma in Upper Secondary School Education.
My work in the OpenEdu project consists mainly of adapting content developed for the Computing and Calculus for Applied Statistics (CCAS) course at the University of Iceland for the new framework that we are developing.
In addition, I also participate in development discussions, where I try to bring an educator's point of view, as well as how we can leverage past experiments, such as [tutor-web](https://tutor-web.net/).

I teach various Mathematics courses at the University of Iceland, in either main or assistant roles.
These are usually Calculus courses, though they can also include topics in Complex Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis and more.

In my spare time, I like spending time with my wife and cat, watching math videos on YouTube and trying out different exercise routines with friends.

## Răzvan Nițu

As part of the OpenEdu (21-COP-0016) team I am charged with defining and maintaining the methodology for creating high quality educational resources.

I am a PhD student at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest in Computer Science and Engineering.
My thesis aims at optimizing memory operations at all possible levels: application, operating system and hardware.
I am an active open source contributor to [the D programming language](https://dlang.org/).

My passions, beyond the field of computer science, include literature, music, film, education techniques, psychology, philosophy, and sports.
I like to discover new experiences and to live anything that is worth living.

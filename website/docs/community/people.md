Hello!
I'm Liza, I am a contributor to the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016).
I operate beyond the scenes with ideas to the methodology of the project and I take care of the project overall presentation.

I finished my Masters degree in Advanced Cybersecurity in 2019 at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania.
I am also a teaching assistant at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, being involved in Computer Programming, Operating Systems and Hardware-Software Interface classes.
I am interested in operating systems, security, low-level programming and a big fan of open source.
I love spending time with students, teaching and finding ways to improve the current education system.

I currently work at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/) as a software engineer, part of the [Connected Home Security](https://www.bitdefender.com/smart-home/) team.

Apart from computer science, I really enjoy skiing, dancing and cooking.

Hi!
I'm Răzvan, I am the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016) director.
I supervise project activities and I am engaged in content development for the [Operating Systems class](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/operating-systems-oer/) and the [Security Summer School](https://github.com/security-summer-school/).
I am in charge of engaging the teaching staff at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest and other universities and educational institutions in Romania.

I am an Associate Professor at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania, the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
I am primarily interested in operating systems and security, with a penchant for teaching and mentoring.
If a class uses "operating systems" as part of its name, it's likely I'm part of the team.
Research-wise I work on software security, particularly [Apple iOS security](https://github.com/malus-security/) and [the Unikraft unikernel](https://unikraft.org/) in recent years.
I am part of the open source and security community in the university and in Romania.

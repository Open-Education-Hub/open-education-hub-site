## Liza Babu

Hello!
I'm Liza, I am a contributor to the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016).
I operate beyond the scenes with ideas to the methodology of the project and I take care of the project overall presentation.

I finished my Masters degree in Advanced Cybersecurity in 2019 at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania.
I am also a teaching assistant at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, being involved in Computer Programming, Operating Systems and Hardware-Software Interface classes.
I am interested in operating systems, security, low-level programming and a big fan of open source.
I love spending time with students, teaching and finding ways to improve the current education system.

I currently work at [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/) as a software engineer, part of the [Connected Home Security](https://www.bitdefender.com/smart-home/) team.

Apart from computer science, I really enjoy skiing, dancing and cooking.

Hi!
I am Mihai. I'm part of the infrastructure team for the OpenEdu project, tasked with developing a solution for distributing educational content.
I am also the developer of VMChecker Next, which is a service where teachers can set up automatic checking for their programming assignments.

I am a graduate of the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania.

My spare time is spent mostly tinkering with different programming concepts and languages.
Among my non-tech-related pastimes, I can count tennis and swimming.

Hi!
I'm Răzvan, I am the OpenEdu project (21-COP-0016) director.
I supervise project activities and I am engaged in content development for the [Operating Systems class](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/operating-systems-oer/) and the [Security Summer School](https://github.com/security-summer-school/).
I am in charge of engaging the teaching staff at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest and other universities and educational institutions in Romania.

I am an Associate Professor at University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, Romania, the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
I am primarily interested in operating systems and security, with a penchant for teaching and mentoring.
If a class uses "operating systems" as part of its name, it's likely I'm part of the team.
Research-wise I work on software security, particularly [Apple iOS security](https://github.com/malus-security/) and [the Unikraft unikernel](https://unikraft.org/) in recent years.
I am part of the open source and security community in the university and in Romania.

## Hulda Hvönn Kristinsdóttir

<img src="/img/people/hulda_kristinsdottir.jpg" title="Hulda Hvönn Kristinsdóttir" width="200" />

Hi!
I'm Hulda.
I have a Bachelors degree in Mathematics and Mathematical Education and a Masters degree in Upper Secondary Education of Mathematics.
My role in the OpenEdu project is to review the content of the Computing and Calculus for Applied Statistics (CCAS) course at the University of Iceland and adapt it to the new system developed by Open Education Hub.

I work full time as a math teacher at the Commercial College of Iceland and as a part time teacher at the University of Iceland.
I particularly enjoy teaching Calculus, Probability and Statistics, but I am also interested in the field of Combinatorics.

I spend most of my spare time taking care of my indoor jungle, doodling and weight lifting.

## Eggert Karl Hafsteinsson

<img src="/img/people/eggert_hafsteinsson.png" title="Eggert Karl Hafsteinsson" width="200" />

Hi!
My name is Eggert Karl.
I'm a math educator.
I have a Masters degree in Mathematics (Multivariate Complex Analysis), Bachelors degrees in Applied Mathematics as well as Computer Science and have an additional diploma in Upper Secondary School Education.
My work in the OpenEdu project consists mainly of adapting content developed for the Computing and Calculus for Applied Statistics (CCAS) course at the University of Iceland for the new framework that we are developing.
In addition, I also participate in development discussions, where I try to bring an educator's point of view, as well as how we can leverage past experiments, such as [tutor-web](https://tutor-web.net/).

I teach various Mathematics courses at the University of Iceland, in either main or assistant roles.
These are usually Calculus courses, though they can also include topics in Complex Analysis, Partial Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis and more.

In my spare time, I like spending time with my wife and cat, watching math videos on YouTube and trying out different exercise routines with friends.

## Vlad Năstase

## Sergiu Weisz

<img src="/img/people/sergiu_weisz.jpg" title="Sergiu Weisz" width="200" />

Hi, I'm Sergiu Weisz and I like teaching.
I am a PhD student at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest with a particular interest in distributed computing.
As part of my thesis I work on providing innovative solutions for managing data for the ALICE experiment at CERN.

I am also a teaching assistant at the University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest, teaching Systems-related classes such as Introduction to Operating Systems and Operating Systems Internals.
I work as a system admin at the university, where I maintain research enabling services such as private clusters, storage solutions and user facing services such as GitLab and the institutional computing grid.

As part of the OpenEdu project I coordinate the infrastructure team, made up of myself, Mihai Băruta and Vlad Năstase.
Our tasks is to develop a software framework that allows teachers and creatives to define resources that then are built into services to be used by students.

I am a nerd, so in my free time I like to tinker with different computing related things such as getting my games to run on Linux, testing new and interesting hardware and finding alternatives to big tech offered services using open source software.

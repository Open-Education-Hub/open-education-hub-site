# Workshop: VMChecker Next - Automation for the Lazy and the Busy

## Setting Up the Environment

You will need to connect to the [guacamole](https://guacamole.grid.pub.ro).
From here you will be able to connect to one of the 40 VMs that we will be using to test the setup.
Please select a virtual machine that is not being used by another person.
You can see this for the `Currently in use by 1 user` text on the left side of the name.

To authenticate to the virtual machine, you will need to use the `workshop/vmchecker` username/password combination.

Each machine has an Ubuntu 20.04 setup where you can work during this workshop.
The user you will connect to is `student`.
The password is `student`.

We will be using two tracks for this workshop.
The [first track](./vmchecker-workshop/vmchecker-moodle-install) is intended for people who already are familiar with Moodle and want to experiment setting up VMchecker for their own institutions.

The [second track](./vmchecker-workshop/vmchecker-hw-standalone-setup) is intended for people who are not familiar with Moodle, but still want a lightweight experience by integrating with VMChecker.

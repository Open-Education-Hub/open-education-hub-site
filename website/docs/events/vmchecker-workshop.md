# Workshop: vmchecker: Main page

## Setting up the environment

You will need to connect to the [guacamole](https://guacamole.grid.pub.ro). From
here you will be able to connect to one of the 30 VMs that we will be using to
test the setup. Please select a virtual machine that is not being used by
another person. You can see this for the `Currently in use by 1 user` text on
the left side of the name.

To authenticate to the virtual machine, you will need to use the
`workshop/vmchecker` username/password combination.

Each machine has an Ubuntu 20.04 setup where you can work during this workshop.
The user you will connect to is `student`. The password is `student`

We will be using two tracks for this workshop. The [first
track](./vmchecker-workshop/vmchecker-hw-setup) is intended for
TAs and UPB staff, who already have access to the production infrastructure for
VMchecker deployed at UPB.

The [second track](./vmchecker-workshop/vmchecker-install) is intended for people from other institutions who want to
experiment with setting up VMchecker for their own institution.

## Project Overview

---

### Why? (1)

Difficulty updating, maintaining content

- Editable / updatable content
- Reviewable
- Yearly snapshots
- Easy to reuse (in other courses / training, by others)

----

### Why? (2)

Student feedback

- Outdated content
- Theoretical, artificial
- Disconnect between courses in curriculum

----

### Why? (3)

Globally:

- Content is not easily accessible
- Not everyone wants / has time to develop good content
- There is vast potential for collaboration and automation

----

### Goal

- Host repositories of OER content together with (automation) infrastructure.
- Teachers / trainers will spend little time on
  - developing content
  - doing tedious / repetitive work (evaluation, grading)

----

### Content: Past, Present, Future

| Classic                     | Wiki                    | GitHub                 |
| :-------------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------------------: |
| not easily modified         | publicly accessible     | easy to contribute     |
| not portable                | difficult to contribute | easy to review         |
| no versioning               | difficult to review     | easy to report issues  |
| spread                      | easy to edit            | easy to reuse (fork)   |

----

### Technologies & Formats

- Markdown
- reveal.md
- Draw.io (SVG), ffmpeg
- Source code, Git

----

### Automate Everything

- Content deployment
- Student / trainee evaluation
- Grading
- Scheduling
- Student work environment

---

### Roles

- Content developers / maintainers
- Teachers / Trainers
- Students / Trainees
- Hobbyists / Professionals / Contributors

----

### Content Developers

- Not all teachers / trainers have the time / pleasure to develop content.
- Content developers are owners of a repository.
- Create, maintain, update, curate the repository.
- Monitor content use, ask for feedback, integrate suggestions.

----

### Teachers / Trainers

- Fork the repository or get parts of the repository.
- Customize, configure content from repository according to their needs & preference.
- Benefit from the (automation) infrastructure.
- (Optionally) Add new content, contribute it back.
- Focus on (live) interaction with students.

----

### Students / Trainees

- Consume content.
- Self-assess.
- (Optionally) Contribute to content, add issues, fixes, proposals.
  Consider incentivizing via educational crypto-currency.

----

### Hobbyists / Professional / Contributors

- Have direct access to content.
- Can assess content according to their needs.
- (Optionally) Contribute to content, add issues, fixes, proposals.

---

### Vision

A repository for each topic hosted on https://github.com/open-education-hub

Teachers / Trainers using forks of repository

Infrastructure to support the deployment of content and automation actions throughout the world

----

### Challenges

How do we evaluate? Content quality, teaching impact, level of (re)usability.

How reliable / available are maintainers for each repository?

How can we make it as easy as possible for teachers to customize their content?

How do we engage the overall community (hobbyists, professionals) to contribute?

How do we help teachers use Git, GitHub & other tools?

----

### Concrete Plan

By September 2023

- 3 content repositories
  - Operating Systems (October 2022 - January 2023)
  - Calculus and Statistics (January - May 2023)
  - Security Summer School (June - July 2023)
- Methodology: roles, develop, use, deploy, guides
- Infrastructure (scripts, configs)

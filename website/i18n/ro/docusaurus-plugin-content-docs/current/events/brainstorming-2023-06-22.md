# Brainstorming: Education in the Digital Age

Good education is always a challenge, even more so in the digital age, where information is readily available and the potential of automation is disrupting existing methods.
Questions come about:

* What makes good digital education materials?
* How to design materials for live usage and for individual study. Should they be separate?
* What should happen face-to-face and what should happen online?
* Which actions are important to automate?
* How do we structure content in repositories?
* How is content made available to educators for reuse, to trainees for use, to anyone to contribute and make suggestions?

And many more.

At Open Education Hub, we think about these items and we aim to create the future of education, given the challenges and opportunities of the digital age, and with the support of all those involved.

On **Thursday, June 22, 2023, starting from 15:00 EEST**, we are organizing a brainstorming meeting to collect ideas and viewpoints from educators regarding education in the digital age.
Our goal is to extract best practices, guides and lessons learned in order to build up the methods, approaches and infrastructure for the future of education, a future that will be tied to digitalization and technology.

In this 2.5 hours **in-person** discussion, we welcome anyone interested in sharing their ideas and in improving their (and others') digital educational contents, infrastructure and teaching methods.
We will have drinks and sweets.

We will spend about one hour discussing the usefulness of slides in the digital age.
Then, for the next part, we will split into breakout groups to discuss several topics;
and, at the end, present those topics to the others.
We will draw conclusions and then announce them to the greater education community.

  1. Public vs private content:
     What content should be available to trainees, what should remain private (such as exam questions)?
     Or what parts of types of content should be public and what parts should be private?
